## Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe game, made using Java (and the JavaFX GUI framework). It features a clean user interface design, an updating scoreboard, and a basic AI that you can play against.

Gradle has been implemented as a build automation tool, hence you don't need to worry about finding and installing the correct version of JavaFX yourself (21.0.8 was used in this project). Gradle will handle this for you. You just need the Java version listed below.

### Prerequisites
* Java (version 24.0.2)

### How to run
* Open a terminal and navigate to this folder.
* Run ```./gradlew run``` if using Linux/Mac, or ```.\gradlew.bat run``` if using Windows.
